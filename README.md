Smart parking management system based on IoT sensors

This repository contains the code for a Smart Parking Management System based on IoT sensors. The system allows drivers to easily find available parking spots and helps parking lot operators to efficiently manage their resources.

The system uses IoT sensors to detect whether a parking spot is occupied or vacant. This information is then sent to a cloud-based server where it is analyzed to provide real-time updates to drivers about available parking spots. The system also allows parking lot operators to track usage, occupancy rates, and generate reports for analysis.

Installation

To install the system, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies.
Set up the IoT sensors and connect them to the cloud-based server.
Configure the server to communicate with the IoT sensors and handle incoming data.
Configure the front-end to display real-time updates to drivers and allow parking lot operators to manage their resources.
Usage

Once the system is installed and configured, it can be used as follows:

Drivers can access the front-end to see real-time updates about available parking spots.
Parking lot operators can access the back-end to track usage, occupancy rates, and generate reports for analysis.
